"""
What is a data structure?
"""

"""
A data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format
they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection
as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure.

Here is a list of data structures which are commonly used:

Arrays
Stacks
Queues
Linked Lists
Trees
Graphs
Tries (they are effectively trees, but itâ€™s still good to call them out separately).
Hash Tables
