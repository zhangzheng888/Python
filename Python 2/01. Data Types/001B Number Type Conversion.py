Number Type Conversion

One type of number can convert into another type. This is also known as coercion.

Operations like addition, subtraction coerce integer to float implicitly (automatically), if one of the
operand is float.

Here are some examples of each type:
"""

print 14 + 21.0
# Output: 35.0

print int(9.4)
# Output 9

print int(2.8)
# Output 2

print int(-4.9)
# Output -4
print float(5)
# Output 5.0

print complex('3+5j')
# Output (3+5j)
