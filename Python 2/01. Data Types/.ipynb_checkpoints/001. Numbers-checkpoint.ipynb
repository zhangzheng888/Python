    "Python supports various \"types\" of numbers: integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers. They are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. 5 is integer whereas 5.0 is a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and isinstance() function to check if it belongs to a particular class."
