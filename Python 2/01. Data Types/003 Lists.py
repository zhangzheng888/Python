Data Type: Lists (Python 2.7)

In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square
brackets [], separated by commas.

List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile data types used in Python.

A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).
