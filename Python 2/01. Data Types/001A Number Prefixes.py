Numbers Prefixes

Numbers commonly used are decimal (base 10) number system. But computer programmers
(generally embedded programmer) need to work with binary (base 2), hexadecimal (base 16) and
octal (base 8) number systems.

Here are some examples of each type:
"""

# Binary
print 0b1101011
# Output: 107

# Octal
print 0xFB + 0b10
# Output: 253 (251 + 2)

# Hexidecimal
print 0o15
# Output: 13
